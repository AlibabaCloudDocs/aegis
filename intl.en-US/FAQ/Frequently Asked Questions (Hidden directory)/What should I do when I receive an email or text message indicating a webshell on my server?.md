# What should I do when I receive an email or text message indicating a webshell on my server? {#concept_44287_zh .concept}

If you receive an email or text message indicating a webshell on your server, an intrusion has been detected and a webshell has been uploaded. The hacker is able to access and modify your website or data in the database.

You can use Server Guard to quarantine the webshell file, and then investigate and prevent the intrusion. Otherwise, the hacker will be able to hack into your system again through the same vulnerability.
